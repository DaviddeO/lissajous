# Lissajous figures

This resrouce looks at combining A-Level Maths and Further Maths with engineering applications.

Specifically, this resource explores how sinusoids and parametric equations are used to describe Lissajous figures, and how these figures have applications in material surface heat treatments.

### Contents:
- LissajousSlides.pdf
    - Slideshow with an overview of Lissajous figures and activities to work through.
- LissajousHints.pdf
    - Hints, tips and possible solutions for the activities in LissajousSlides.pdf. (To-do)
- lissajous.py
    - An interactive app which plots Lissajous figures for user-defined parameters. Can also animate those plots.
- lissajousPlot.py
    - The script for an interactive plot of Lissajous figures, with sliders to adjust the parameters.
- lissajousSimple.py
    - A simple script demonstrating how to plot a Lissajous figure using Python.
- gaussPow.py
    - A script for determining the energy distribution of a laser surface heat scanner.

### Using the Python scripts

- All the scripts require NumPy and Matplotlib to be installed.
- To run lissajous.py, wxPython and PyOpenGL (and PyOpenGL-accelerate) are also required.
    - On Windows and Mac machines, these can be easily installed using the pip tool.
    - On Linux machines, certain dependencies need to be installed as well in order for wxPython to work.
